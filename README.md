# kubernetes-apps
A collection of k8s apps I run at home.

** Note: App passwords have been scrubbed. You must generate your own passwords!

This was written for Kubernetes 1.12. It is possible this will not run on a newer version of k8s w/out some minor changees.

Most of these apps may have helm charts for them now. You should use the helm chart and only use these files for reference.

Most apps are configured for HTTPS & iSCSI.
